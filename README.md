# Beyond Model Adaptation at Test Time

This repository includes the mentioned test-time adaptation papers in **Beyond Model Adaptation at Test Time: A Survey**

## What to adapt

We categorize the test-time adaptation methods into five main categories, based on what they adapt: the **model**, the **inference**, the **normalization**, the **sample**, or the **prompt**. 
The categorizations and paper links are provided in [What to adapt](https://github.com/zzzx1224/Papers-of-test-time-adaptation/blob/main/What%20to%20adapt.md).

## Training & adaptation settings

We also summarize the main **training** and **adaptation** settings of the test-time adaptation methods, details and papers are in [How to prepare](https://github.com/zzzx1224/Papers-of-test-time-adaptation/blob/main/How%20to%20prepare%20for%20adaptation.md) (training settings) and [How to adapt](https://github.com/zzzx1224/Papers-of-test-time-adaptation/blob/main/How%20to%20adapt.md) (adaptation settings), respectively.
