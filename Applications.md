## Applications

Test-time adaptation has recently been applied to an expanding range of tasks. We review the literature on test-time adaptation across image-level, video-level, and 3D tasks, as well as applications beyond the field of vision.

### Image-level

#### Image classification

Image classification is the most investigated task in test-time adaptation due to its ease of implementing various distribution shifts, straightforward evaluation, and generalization to other tasks. Most works in [What to adapt.md](https://github.com/zzzx1224/Papers-of-test-time-adaptation/blob/main/What%20to%20adapt.md) are conducted on the image classification task.
